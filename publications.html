<b>Abstract:</b> A stochastic neuron, a key hardware kernel for 
implementing stochastic neural networks, is constructed using an 
insulator-metal-transition (IMT) device based on electrically induced 
phase-transition in series with a tunable resistance. We show that such 
an IMT neuron has dynamics similar to a piecewise linear FitzHugh-Nagumo
 (FHN) neuron. Spiking statistics of such neurons are demonstrated 
experimentally using Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) based IMT neurons, and 
modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process with a fluctuating 
boundary. The stochastic spiking is explained by thermal noise and 
threshold fluctuations acting as precursors of bifurcation which result 
in a sigmoid-like transfer function. Moments of interspike intervals are
 calculated analytically by extending the first-passage-time (FPT) 
models for Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process to include a fluctuating 
boundary. We find that the coefficient of variation of interspike 
intervals depend on the relative proportion of thermal and threshold 
noise. In the current experimental demonstrations where both kinds of 
noise are present, the coefficient of variation is about an order of 
magnitude higher compared to the case where only thermal noise were 
present.

<b>Abstract:</b> Stochastic sampling machines (SSM) utilize neural 
sampling from probabilistic spiking neurons to escape local minima and 
prevent overfitting of training datasets [1]. This enables improved 
error rates compared to deterministic implementations, and, in turn, 
enables lower bit precision, decreased chip area, and reduced energy 
consumption. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate: (i) 
Insulator-to-Metal Phase Transition (IMT) neurons with record low peak 
operating power of 11.9Î¼W at VDD=0.7V; (ii) the IMT in vanadium dioxide 
(VO2) provides a natural probabilistic hardware substrate for realizing a
 compact stochastic IMT neuron for SSMs; (iii) implementation of SSM for
 pattern recognition on MNIST database [2] using experimentally 
calibrated device modeling. These results are compared to a 22nm CMOS 
ASIC which shows stochastic IMT neuron based SSMs result in a 4.5x 
reduction in system power consumption.

<div class="abstract">
<b>Abstract:</b> While Boolean logic has been the backbone of digital 
information processing, there exist classes of computationally hard 
problems wherein this paradigm is fundamentally inefficient. Vertex 
coloring of graphs, belonging to the class of combinatorial 
optimization, represents one such problem. It is well studied for its 
applications in data sciences, life sciences, social sciences and 
technology, and hence, motivates alternate, more efficient non-Boolean 
pathways towards its solution. Here we demonstrate a coupled relaxation 
oscillator based dynamical system that exploits insulator-metal 
transition in Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) to efficiently solve vertex 
coloring of graphs. Pairwise coupled VO2 oscillator circuits have been 
analyzed before for basic computing operations, but using complex 
networks of VO2 oscillators, or any other oscillators, for more complex 
tasks have been challenging in theory as well as in experiments. The 
proposed VO2 oscillator network harnesses the natural analogue between 
optimization problems and energy minimization processes in highly 
parallel, interconnected dynamical systems to approximate optimal 
coloring of graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection between
 spectral properties of linear dynamical systems and spectral algorithms
 for graph coloring. Our work not only elucidates a physics-based 
computing approach but also presents tantalizing opportunities for 
building customized analog co-processors for solving hard problems 
efficiently.

<div class="abstract">
<b>Abstract:</b> Computing with networks of synchronous oscillators has 
attracted wide-spread attention as novel materials and device topologies
 have enabled realization of compact, scalable and low-power coupled 
oscillatory systems. Of particular interest are compact and low-power 
relaxation oscillators that have been recently demonstrated using MIT 
(metal-insulator-transition) devices using properties of correlated 
oxides. Further the computational capability of pairwise coupled 
relaxation oscillators has also been shown to outperform traditional 
Boolean digital logic circuits. This paper presents an analysis of the 
dynamics and synchronization of a system of two such identical coupled 
relaxation oscillators implemented with MIT devices. We focus on two 
implementations of the oscillator: (a) a D-D configuration where 
complementary MIT devices (D) are connected in series to provide 
oscillations and (b) a D-R configuration where it is composed of a 
resistor (R) in series with a voltage-triggered state changing MIT 
device (D). The MIT device acts like a hysteresis resistor with 
different resistances in the two different states. The synchronization 
dynamics of such a system has been analyzed with purely charge based 
coupling using a resistive (RC) and a capacitive (CC) element in 
parallel. It is shown that in a D-D configuration symmetric, identical 
and capacitively coupled relaxation oscillator system synchronizes to an
 anti-phase locking state, whereas when coupled resistively the system 
locks in phase. Further, we demonstrate that for certain range of values
 of RC and CC, a bistable system is possible which can have potential 
applications in associative computing. In D-R configuration, we 
demonstrate the existence of rich dynamics including non-monotonic flows
 and complex phase relationship governed by the ratios of the coupling 
impedance. Finally, the developed theoretical formulations have been 
shown to explain experimentally measured waveforms of such pairwise 
coupled relaxation oscillators.
